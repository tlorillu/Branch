### How to file a Chrome issue for typed-in links issue

1. Visit https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list and click **New issue** at the top left

2. Enter/choose the following values into the first page of the form and click Next at the bottom:

    _Chrome version:_ 40 +

    _Operating system:_ Android

    _Version:_ Any

    _Channel:_ Stable

    _Flash version:_ n/a

3. Choose "Content" and click Next at the bottom

4. Enter/choose the following values:

    _Please enter a one-line summary:_ Typed-in links disallow redirect to Chrome intent to open native app

    _What specific URL can reproduce the problem?_ https://bnc.lt/chromeissue

    _Does the problem occur on multiple sites?_ Yes

    _Is it a problem with a plugin?_ No

    _Does this feature work correctly other browsers?:_ Yes

    _Steps to reproduce the problem:_

        1. Type-in or paste in the link directly to Android Chrome 40+
        2. Press Go
        3. See an empty, blank screen

    _What is the expected behavior?_

        Should redirect to the Play Store if the app is not installed, or open up the app if it is installed. We're setting window.location to the proper intent string as specified here:
        https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/intents

        If you instead send yourself that same URL via email, SMS or whatever, then click it, you'll notice that the redirect to the Play Store or to the app occurs correctly.

    _What went wrong?_

        In some release in Chrome 40, it was decided that typed-in URLs should prevent automated redirects. It seems that there wasn't much of an issue that was resolved here, and the intention was lost as the issue was passed from person to person.
        https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=331571

        This change unfortunately hurts developers who don't have mobile websites and depend on redirects to drive a majority of their app traffic. We have had to build an intermediate splash page with a giant button that launches the Chrome intent when pressed, when the most optimal user experience would be a redirect to the Play Store or the app.

    _Did this work before?_ Yes

    _When did it work?_ Pre 40

    _Any other comments?_ Please help us.
